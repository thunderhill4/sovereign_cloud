# Sub-60s Target Cluster Provisioning — Strategy, Attempts, and What's Next

## TL;DR

- **Baseline (legacy `:latest` image):** 90–150s time-to-ready (p95).
- **Current (`:preinit` image, Phase 1 shipped):** ~136s in the one measurement we have.
- **Target:** <60s p95.
- **Gap:** we have **not** broken past the legacy band. The change that was supposed to deliver the speedup (preserving k3s state in the golden image) is neutralized by CAPK's bootstrap model — explained below.
- **Path to <60s:** requires one of the "Option B/C" strategies in §5, not more tuning of the current approach.

---

## 1. The provisioning pipeline (what takes time)

```
kubectl apply -f <cluster.yaml>
  → CAPI Cluster created                                             (~1s)
  → CAPK DataVolume clone kicks off                                  (0s if pre-pulled)
  → KubeVirt VMI scheduled → Pending → Running                       (~30–60s, dominated by clone if not pre-pulled)
  → cloud-init: write_files (CAs, config.yaml) + runcmd              (~5–10s)
  → /opt/install.sh: systemctl enable+start k3s                      (~1s)
  → k3s.service ExecStartPre = firstboot-regen.sh
      → k3s server --cluster-reset                                    (~20–30s)
  → k3s.service ExecStart = k3s server                                (~10–20s)
  → CAPK control-plane service + MetalLB IP binding                   (~5–10s)
  → KThreesControlPlane marks `Initialized`                           (~5s)
  → MachineDeployment creates worker VMI                              (starts AFTER CP is Ready)
  → worker VMI Running → k3s-agent joins                              (~30–60s)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total observed (preinit): ~136s                Target: <60s
```

Note the serialization: **the worker VM doesn't even start booting until the control-plane is `Ready`**. That's ~60s we can't reclaim without parallelizing or pre-booting.

---

## 2. What was tried (Phase 1 as planned)

The plan lived at [`/home/mahipal/.claude/plans/this-is-a-longterm-humming-moon.md`](the approved Phase 1–5 plan).

Phase 1 bake (`bake-common.sh`) preserved full k3s state in the golden image:
- `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/` — etcd DB with CRDs, RBAC, system charts
- `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/` — CA + leaf certs
- `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/` — airgap tarballs
- `firstboot-regen.sh` installed as k3s.service `ExecStartPre`

Hypothesis: first boot runs `k3s server --cluster-reset` (keeps DB, issues fresh etcd cluster ID), so each new cluster skips cold etcd bootstrap, cert gen, bootstrap-data write, system-chart apply. Estimated savings: 30–60s.

---

## 3. What failed, and how it was fixed

### 3.1 Clone DataVolume stuck at `WaitForFirstConsumer`

**Symptom:** `ubuntu-noble-k3s-preinit` DV sat at WFFC phase indefinitely; bake loop polled "DataVolume phase: …" with no progress.

**Root cause:** the default storage class uses WaitForFirstConsumer binding — CDI defers the import until a pod actually mounts the PVC. No pod = no mount = no progress.

**Fix:** added `cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.bind.immediate.requested: "true"` annotation on the import DV in `scripts/import-base-images.sh`.

### 3.2 Source DV `ubuntu-noble-dv` missing

**Symptom:** CDI reported `CloneWithoutSource: The source pvc ubuntu-noble-dv doesn't exist`. The repo assumes the base Ubuntu cloud image is imported but has no script to do it.

**Fix:** added `scripts/import-base-images.sh` that imports both `ubuntu-noble-dv` (~600 MB) and `ubuntu-minimal-noble-dv` (~300 MB) from the Ubuntu cloud-images HTTP URLs via CDI `http:` source.

### 3.3 CA-injection conflict → `k3s --cluster-reset` infinite loop

**Symptom (the big one):** cluster stuck at `KThreesControlPlane: WaitingForKthreesServer` for 20+ minutes. Inside the CP VM, k3s.service was `activating` (not `active`). The firstboot-regen log (`/var/log/k3s-firstboot-reset.log`) was spamming:

```
CA cert validation failed: Get "https://127.0.0.1:6444/cacerts":
  tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

**Root cause:** two-CA state on disk.
1. The bake generated k3s CAs (server-ca, client-ca, etcd/server-ca) during its warm-up init and signed every leaf cert (`client-admin.crt`, `serving-kube-apiserver.crt`, etc.) against them.
2. CAPK bootstrap writes **fresh per-cluster CAs** into the VM via cloud-init `write_files` — overwriting **only the `*-ca.crt` + `*-ca.key` files**, not the leaves.
3. So on first boot: CAs are CAPK's, but leaves + `dynamic-cert.json` + `cred/*.kubeconfig` are still bake-signed.
4. `k3s server --cluster-reset` starts its supervisor at `127.0.0.1:6444`, which presents a cert from `dynamic-cert.json` (bake-signed). The k3s client in the same process trusts `server-ca.crt` (CAPK's). Mismatch → retry forever.

This failure mode is invisible in design docs that only reason about etcd identity. It only showed up under real end-to-end boot.

**Fix:** in the CP's `preK3sCommands` (runs **after** CAPK `write_files` lands the fresh CAs, **before** k3s starts), purge everything in `/server/tls/` that isn't a CA:

```yaml
preK3sCommands:
  - rm -f /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
  - find /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -type f
      ! -name '*-ca.crt' ! -name '*-ca.key' ! -name '*-ca.nochain.crt'
      -delete
```

k3s regenerates every leaf + `dynamic-cert.json` from the CAPK CAs on next start. `--cluster-reset` then validates cleanly, etcd comes up, API responds.

This fix is already in `03-target-cluster/target-cluster.tmpl.yaml` and `03-target-cluster/target-cluster-preinit-test.yaml`.

### 3.4 Why the fix neutralizes most of the speedup

The preservation-win plan assumed `/server/tls` survives to first boot. Since it doesn't (we purge it), k3s regenerates every leaf cert (~5–10s), and `--cluster-reset` (~20–30s) still runs to issue fresh etcd identity. The only real wins left:

- Pre-pulled airgap images → no CRD/system-chart download or apply.
- Preserved `/server/db` → RBAC and CRDs already in etcd (saves ~5–10s of initial apply).
- k3s binary + systemd unit baked in → no install-script download or first-boot compile.

Net: comparable to the tuned legacy `:latest` image. The sub-60s target needs a **different strategy**, not more tuning of this one.

---

## 4. What shipped (Phases 2–5, working)

Independent of the Phase 1 speedup result, the following are in and working:

- `bake-common.sh` — shared bake payload, parameterized by env.
- `bake-golden-image-minimal.sh` — Ubuntu Minimal variant (~300 MB base + k3s).
- `03-target-cluster/target-cluster.tmpl.yaml` — single manifest template driving both image variants.
- Backend renders + applies the template per deploy: `ui/backend/handlers/cluster_deploy.go` `runDeployment(profile, image)`.
- Make targets: `target-cluster-{lite,full}-{preinit,minimal}`, wired to `scripts/render-cluster.sh`.
- UI: profile + image variant toggles in `ClusterManager.tsx`, `api.deployCluster(profile, image)`.
- `scripts/import-base-images.sh`, `scripts/render-cluster.sh`, `scripts/time-to-ready.sh`.

So the multi-option UX — pick Noble or Minimal, pick lite or full — works end-to-end. What **doesn't** work is "sub-60s".

---

## 5. How to actually get under 60s

Ranked by likely impact and invasiveness.

### Option A (cheap, ~10–20s win) — Parallelize CP and worker boot

CAPK defaults to starting the worker only after CP is `Ready`. That's ~60s of serialized wait.

**Approach:** remove the MachineDeployment's implicit dependency by pre-creating the worker VMI before CP is Ready, then gate k3s-agent startup (not VM boot) on CP API availability.

- Worker's `kthreesConfigSpec.postK3sCommands` already waits for the supervisor URL. If the VM boots in parallel with CP, k3s-agent retries its join until CP serves — adds maybe 5–10s of idle retry, saves ~40s of serialized boot.
- Tradeoff: slight risk that worker k3s-agent retries burn log noise. Acceptable.

Projected: ~100s → **~75s**. Still not <60s.

### Option B (high impact, ~40–60s win) — Warm VM pool

The original plan flagged this as "out of scope, revisit if Phase 1 misses <60s" — which is where we are.

**Approach:** keep N pre-booted target-cluster VMs in a `Paused` state. On deploy, resume the pool, re-identify them as the new cluster (re-run firstboot-regen logic), and hand over.

- CP comes up in <10s (VM already booted, k3s already warm).
- Worker in parallel, same pool.
- Main cost shifts to pool maintenance, not user-visible deploy.

Projected: **20–40s** per deploy, once pool is warm.

Tradeoffs:
- Maintenance load: need to refresh pool after deletes.
- Memory: pool VMs consume RAM while idle.
- Identity re-issue at resume time is tricky — each cluster needs distinct etcd cluster ID, kubelet identity, node name. The `--cluster-reset` path we already have is the right primitive, but it has to run on resume without blocking.

### Option C (invasive, 30–50s win) — Skip `--cluster-reset` by renaming etcd member in place

The approved plan **rejected** this approach (etcd raft WAL has the cluster ID, renaming dirs won't reissue a cluster ID). But if `--cluster-reset` is the dominant cost and we can't eliminate it, forking the k3s-side logic to do an in-place metadata rewrite might be the only way.

**Approach:** stop k3s → `etcdutl` surgery to write new cluster ID into WAL + snapshot → restart. Risky (WAL format is internal) but avoids the 20–30s of `--cluster-reset`.

This is a research project, not a week of work.

### Option D (invasive, hard to estimate) — Custom bootstrap provider

CAPK writes CAs because it wants to manage cluster identity from the management cluster. A custom bootstrap provider (or a CAPK patch) could be told "the target cluster already has a CA — fetch it via the kubeconfig secret instead of injecting."

**Approach:** fork `KThreesConfig` logic, or sit a mutating admission webhook in front of it to strip the `write_files` CA entries. Then the bake-signed leaves + dynamic-cert.json stay valid — no purge, no regen, maybe no `--cluster-reset`.

Projected: **50–70s**, if combined with the other wins.

Tradeoff: upstream-drift risk, ongoing maintenance.

---

## 6. Recommendation

1. **Ship what we have now** — Phases 1–5 deliver the multi-image UX and a working pipeline. 136s is not the target, but it's not worse than legacy.
2. **If <60s becomes business-critical:** go straight to **Option B (warm VM pool)**. Everything else is smaller wins with similar effort.
3. **Don't** keep tuning the Phase 1 preserved-state approach. It's CA-injection-bound and will not break through the ~100s floor with CAPK in the picture.

---

## 7. Reproducing today's result

```bash
# one-time
./scripts/import-base-images.sh                    # ~3 min, ~900 MB download
make bake-image-preinit                            # ~7 min
make build-containerdisk-preinit                   # ~2 min
make pre-pull-preinit                              # seconds

# per run
kubectl delete cluster target-cluster --ignore-not-found --wait=true
./scripts/time-to-ready.sh                         # apply → 2/2 Ready
```

Expected: ~130–150s total to `RESULT:` line. p95 over 5 runs will take ~15 min of wall time.

---

## 6. Phase-level measurement (2026-09-09) — instrumentation, and three dead ends

Everything above was judged on a single aggregate number. `scripts/phase-timings.sh`
(new) attributes the wall clock per phase, read-only and without SSH (the
`v1.subresources.kubevirt.io` APIService is `Available=False` on this host, so
`virtctl ssh/console` is unusable). Guest uptime is anchored to wall clock from
cloud-init's own log lines, which carry an absolute date and the uptime together.

### The real budget (warm path, median of 3 clean runs)

```
apply → VMI created            6.6s   14%   CAPI/CAPK/KThrees controller chain
launcher pod → qemu running   10.0s   21%   8s of it is containerDisk unpack
firmware + kernel + initramfs  3.7s    8%
systemd + cloud-init → k3s     5.5s   12%
CP k3s → first 200 /readyz     7.0s   15%
worker join after API ready   11.8s   25%
──────────────────────────────────────
median total                  50.0s          (52.7 / 50.0 / 46.6)
```

**36% of the wall clock (16.6s) elapses before the guest kernel starts.** No
image-side change can reach it. This is a third, independent reason the `:preinit`
and `:warm` experiments could not have delivered what they promised.

### Dead end 3 — gating the worker on CP readiness

Hypothesis: the k3s agent starts at t+26.7s, the API first answers at t+34.8s, and the
agent retries on a ~5s cycle, so it lands on the t+36.7s attempt — 1.9s of pure
quantization loss. Fix: spin on `/readyz` (which answers unauthenticated) before
starting the agent.

**Result: 53.1s median, a 3.1s REGRESSION.** The premise was wrong. The journal shows
the agent starts containerd *before* it fetches config, so the retry window is
productive work overlapping CP boot. Delaying the agent serialized it. Reverted.

### Dead end 4 — the `no route to host` dials

KubeVirt bridge binding gives the guest the launcher pod's address *and* its /24, so
the guest treats every pod IP as on-link and ARPs for it — but pod-to-pod on kindnet
is L3-routed, not one L2 segment, so the ARP cannot resolve. The agent learns the CP's
**pod** IP from the supervisor and dials it directly, taking `connect: no route to
host` three times at ~3.1s each before falling back to the VIP. It also received a
stale `10.0.2.2:6443` (the QEMU slirp gateway) baked into the warm datastore.

Routing the pod CIDR via the gateway fixes it completely: 6 errors → 0, one clean dial,
one apiserver address. **Timing benefit: none (54.3s median).** The journal shows why —
between `"Running kubelet --address=0.0.0.0"` and the kubelet's first output there is a
**10s silent gap**, and the failed dials were running *concurrently inside* it, not
adding to it. A real bug, worth keeping for correctness; not a speedup.

### Fixed: workers were starting the k3s SERVER unit

The worker bootstrap passed the mode as `INSTALL_K3S_EXEC='agent'`, but the baked
`/opt/install.sh` parses only positional args and ignores the env var, so it defaulted
to server. `k3s server` failed ~0.8s later and, because install.sh runs under `set -e`,
aborted the script before writing the `bootstrap-success.complete` sentinel (harmless
only because `virtualMachineBootstrapCheck.checkStrategy: none` is set). Fixed by
passing `agent` positionally. Verified: `Mode: k3s-agent`, zero `k3s.service` failures.

### FIXED: the 10s kubelet gap — 50.0s -> 42.7s

Debug logging on the agent named it exactly:

```
Dial error from server 10.244.0.186:6443@UNCHECKED after 10.000162522s: i/o timeout
```

A **10.000s TCP dial timeout**, with the kubelet's first log line landing 7ms after it
expires — kubelet start is gated on the agent's tunnel dial. The address being dialled
is the **control plane's pod IP**, handed to the worker by the supervisor's apiserver
endpoint list. And that address cannot work:

```
node -> CP VM pod IP:6443   =  200, connect 0.0003s
pod  -> CP VM pod IP:6443   =  timeout
```

**A KubeVirt VM's pod address is reachable from the node but not from other pods.** The
worker's k3s agent runs inside a pod, so it can never reach it; it waits out the full
timeout before falling back to the VIP it already had configured as `default`.

Fix: `advertise-address: <API_LB_IP>` appended to the CP's `config.yaml` in
`preK3sCommands`, so the supervisor advertises the VIP every VM already reaches.
Applied to `target-cluster-warm.yaml`, `target-cluster-warm.tmpl.yaml`, and
`target-cluster-parallel.yaml`.

| | baseline | fixed |
|---|---|---|
| median time-to-ready | 50.0s | **42.7s** |
| runs | 52.7 / 50.0 / 46.6 | 42.7 / 42.8 / 41.2 |
| run-to-run spread | 6.1s | **1.6s** |
| dial timeouts per run | 4-6 | **0** |
| worker join after API ready | 11.8s | 5.1s |

The spread collapsing from 6.1s to 1.6s matters as much as the median: the 10s timeout
was also the dominant source of run-to-run variance. Verified safe — the `kubernetes`
service endpoint becomes the VIP and a pod in the target cluster still reaches
`kubernetes.default` (200).

Two false starts on the way, both worth recording. The dials were *first* seen failing
with `no route to host`, because bridge binding also hands the guest the pod CIDR as an
on-link /24 so it ARPs for a pod IP that is L3-routed. Routing that subnet via the
gateway removed the ARP failure — and bought nothing, because the dial then simply
blackholed for the same 10s. And the gap measured 10.019s / 10.017s across runs with
completely different dial behaviour, which looked like proof of a fixed timer unrelated
to the dials; it was actually the dial timeout itself, reached by two different routes.

### FIXED: the 8s containerDisk phase — 42.7s -> 34.5s

KubeVirt gives its per-VM support containers microscopic CPU limits by default:

| container | image | cpu limit | start |
|---|---|---|---|
| `guest-console-log` (virt-tail) | virt-launcher | **15m** | +3.0s |
| `volumesystemdisk` (containerDisk) | noble-k3s 1.17GB | **10m** | +9.0s |
| `compute` (virt-launcher) | virt-launcher | *(none)* | +9.0s |

`10m` is 1% of a core: the CFS quota grants ~1ms per 100ms period, so even
`container-disk --no-op` needs dozens of periods just to dynamically link and fault
in its pages. Deterministic 8.0s on every VM, every start.

Isolated by elimination — each of these was measured and ruled out first:

| hypothesis | test | result |
|---|---|---|
| image size (1.17GB) | mount same image as an *image volume* | container started **+0.0s** |
| concurrency/contention | solo VMI, nothing else starting | **9.0s** — worse than 8.0s |
| node CRI latency | trivial 2-container pod | **1.0s** total |
| image-volume mounting | as above | fast |

The tell was that the cost is *deterministic* (8.0s every run) — the signature of a
quota, not of load. Fix: `supportContainerResources` on the KubeVirt CR, applied by
`scripts/configure-kubevirt-perf.sh` (`make kubevirt-perf`, and auto-run from
`02-capi-init/init-management-cluster.sh` so it survives a rebuild). The limits are a
ceiling, not a reservation — these containers are idle after startup.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| containerDisk phase | 8.0s | **1.0s** |
| pod → qemu running | 10.0s | 4.0s |
| median time-to-ready | 42.7s | **34.5s** |
| runs | 42.7 / 42.8 / 41.2 | 34.5 / 34.2 / 34.7 |
| spread | 1.6s | **0.5s** |

### Where the two fixes leave things

```
baseline                 50.0s   (52.7 / 50.0 / 46.6, spread 6.1s)
+ advertise-address      42.7s   (42.7 / 42.8 / 41.2, spread 1.6s)
+ supportContainerRes    34.5s   (34.5 / 34.2 / 34.7, spread 0.5s)
                       ────────
                        -15.5s   (-31%), gate was <40s
```

Both fixes are one-line configuration, not architecture. Neither is an image change —
which is the running theme of this document: every attempt to make the *image* smarter
(`:preinit`, `:warm`) failed, while the two things that worked were a bad advertised
address and a CPU quota. The spread collapsing 6.1s → 0.5s is worth as much as the
median: the pipeline is now predictable enough that a 1s regression is visible.

### What is actually left, by measured size

0. ~~10s kubelet gap~~ and ~~8s containerDisk~~ — **both fixed above.**
1. **~6s CAPI controller chain before the guest boots** (apply → VMI created).
   Untouched by any image or guest work.
2. **~10s silent gap inside kubelet startup on the worker** — the single largest
   in-guest item, and completely opaque so far.
3. **7s CP k3s → API ready.**
4. **5.5s systemd + cloud-init.** Note this is the phase a systemd-less image would
   attack; a perfect result there is worth ~3s, so it is the *fourth* lever, not the
   first.

### Measurement caveat that limits all of the above

Run-to-run spread on this host is **~6s** (baseline 46.6–52.7). With N=3 that swamps
any lever smaller than ~5s. Anything finer needs N≥7, or a quiet host, or both.

---

## 7. The CAPI chain after the September upgrade (2026-09-23) — a CAPK watch bug

Same-session baseline (`scripts/time-to-ready-by-name.sh --runs 3`, warm manifest,
upstream CAPK v0.11.2): **31.3 / 33.2 / 62.8s**. The 62.8s run was not guest-side:
the control-plane VM was created 30s after its bootstrap data was ready, while the
worker VM (static bootstrap) appeared at +5s.

Two stacked CAPK bugs, both from CAPK v0.11.2 being built against CAPI v1.11 while
still watching the **v1beta1** API types:

1. **All three CAPK watches are dead.** `KubevirtMachine<-Machine`,
   `KubevirtMachine<-Cluster`, `KubevirtCluster<-Cluster` watch v1beta1 objects, but
   CAPI v1.11's `util.MachineToInfrastructureMapFunc`, `util.ClusterToInfrastructureMapFunc`
   and the cluster predicates type-assert `*v1beta2` objects. The assertion fails on
   every event, so nothing is ever enqueued. CAPK learns that
   `Machine.Spec.Bootstrap.DataSecretName` is set only when an unrelated event or a
   10-20s `RequeueAfter` happens to fire (observed: 20.5s in one run).
2. **The "waiting for bootstrap data" path dials the target API.** `reconcileNormal`
   returns a zero result while waiting, which falls through to `updateNodeProviderID`
   and a workload-API call to the VIP — before any VM exists. With no backend, the dial
   fails in anything from 2s (`connection refused`) to the full 30s client-go dial
   timeout (`i/o timeout`), and the reconcile is blocked for all of it.

Across the three baseline runs, "bootstrap data ready -> CP VM created" was
**2.0 / 11.2 / 30.0s** — the entire run-to-run spread.

**Fix:** `02-capi-init/patch-capk.sh` (`make capk-patch`, auto-run from
`init-management-cluster.sh`) builds CAPK from `capk-patches/<tag>.patch` — watch the
v1beta2 types, skip the providerID lookup while no bootstrap data exists, bound
workload-API calls to 5s — and layers only the binary onto the official image.
Keyed to the installed CAPK tag; on any other tag it warns and does nothing.
**Cluster state, not manifest state: re-run after any cluster2 rebuild.**

| CAPK | both nodes Ready (s) | median | spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| upstream v0.11.2 | 31.3 / 33.2 / 62.8 | 33.2 | 31.5 |
| patched | 34.4 / 32.8 / 33.4 | 33.4 | **1.6** |

**This is a tail fix, not a median win.** A lucky upstream run was already ~33s; the
patch makes every run that. Chain after the fix: VIP assigned / KubevirtCluster Ready
+3s, Machines +4-5s, CP bootstrap secret +6s, both VMs +6-7s.

**Measurement fix found on the way:** `time-to-ready-by-name.sh` polled with
`kubectl` and no request timeout, so its own dial to the backend-less VIP could hang
and overstate the result (seen: node Ready timestamps +24s/+31s, script 34.8s for both).
It now uses `--request-timeout=2s`. The A/B above was measured after that fix.

---

## 8. The worker join (2026-09-23) — k3s's jittered config retry, and a taint nobody removed

After §7 the budget was: CP Ready ~25.5s, worker Ready 6-9s later. The worker
journal (read via SSH through cluster2's node netns) showed where the gap went:

```
06:25:05.1  agent starts; CA fetch fails (CP API not up), retries every 2s
06:25:10.25 "Waiting to retrieve agent configuration; server is not ready:
             serving-kubelet.crt: 503"                         <- 0.27s too early
06:25:10.52 CP: "Kube API server is now running"
06:25:17.4  agent retries, gets config, starts containerd -> kubelet -> registered 19.3
```

k3s v1.37's agent-config loop is `wait.JitterUntilWithContext(..., 5*time.Second, 1.0, ...)`
— a **random 5-10s** between attempts. A first attempt that lands even a fraction of a
second before the supervisor's runtime core is ready costs 5-10s of idle time, and
that jitter was also most of the remaining run-to-run spread.

### Dead end 3 revisited — gating the agent now works

§6 recorded gating the agent on CP readiness as a 3.1s *regression* on k3s v1.31,
because the agent then started containerd *before* fetching config, so the wait
overlapped useful work. **On v1.37 the order is reversed**: containerd starts only
after the config arrives (`Running containerd` right after the config fetch), so
holding the agent back costs nothing.

**Probe choice matters.** First attempt used `/v1-k3s/config` (token auth): it answered
200 ~2s *before* the CP API was up, so the gate opened early and the agent hit the same
503 — no gain (32.8s). The 503 comes from the node-password check (`controller == nil`
-> `ErrCoreNotReady`); probing that directly would create a node-password secret for
the probe's name. The right probe is the supervisor's own **`/v1-k3s/readyz`** (token
auth, no side effects), which 503s until `Runtime.Core` is set.

The static worker bootstrap now spins on it every 0.2s (bounded ~5 min) before
`install.sh agent`. Agent timeline after: CP API up 03.00 -> gate open, agent starts
03.57 -> containerd 04.98 (no retry) -> registered 06.77.

### The worker was never schedulable

The same journal showed `k3s-agent` failing after exactly 15 minutes with
`network policy controller failed to wait for node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized
taint to be removed`, then restarting forever — and cloud-init blocked on it for ~30 min.
The static bootstrap passed `kubelet-arg: cloud-provider=external`, but the CP runs
`disable-cloud-controller: true` with no CCM, so nothing ever removed the taint: the
worker went Ready but `NoSchedule`, and every pod in the cluster ran on the CP. Removed
the flag (warm, warm.tmpl, parallel). Worker now untainted, agent `active`,
cloud-init `done`. No timing effect on its own (median 33.0s).

| change (cumulative, patched CAPK) | both nodes Ready (s) | median |
|---|---|---|
| before | 34.4 / 32.8 / 33.4 | 33.4 |
| drop `cloud-provider=external` | 30.6 / 34.6 / 33.0 | 33.0 |
| + gate on `/v1-k3s/config` (wrong probe) | 33.9 / 32.8 / 31.6 | 32.8 |
| + gate on `/v1-k3s/readyz` | 28.9 / 29.0 / 30.8 | **29.0** |

Worker now joins 3.4-4s after the CP (was 6-9s).

### Exposed: cross-node pod networking does not work

With the taint gone, pods schedule on the worker — and it turns out **VM-to-VM traffic
has never worked**: worker VM -> CP VM IP is 100% loss both ways, the on-link ARP for the
other VM is `FAILED`, and routing it via the gateway (10.244.0.1) still drops — the same
blackhole as §6 "dead end 4" (node -> VM works, forwarded pod -> VM does not). So flannel
VXLAN between the nodes has no path. metrics-server has always failed to scrape the worker
(`no route to host`), and now CoreDNS can land on the worker where CP pods cannot reach it.
Before this change the taint hid it by keeping everything on the CP. **Open; not a timing
issue.**
