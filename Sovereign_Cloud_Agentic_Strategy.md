# Sovereign Cloud × Sympozium: Agentic AI Strategy

**Project:** `thunderhill4/sovereign_cloud` — KubeVirt Multi-Cluster Platform
**Agentic layer:** Sympozium (Kubernetes-native agent control plane)
**Author mode:** Sovereign / air-gap-friendly, local-LLM-first

---

## 1. The Lay of the Land

### 1.1 What `sovereign_cloud` is today

A two-Kind-cluster reference architecture that models a real sovereign cloud:

- **cluster1** — application plane. Istio ambient mode (ztunnel, sidecar-free L4 mTLS), runs `mc-demo/httpbin` behind MetalLB `172.18.255.200`.
- **cluster2** — management plane. Runs CAPI + CAPK + KubeVirt + CDI + MetalLB (`.211–.220`). Provisions **target-cluster** — a full k3s Kubernetes cluster whose control-plane and worker nodes are **KubeVirt VMs**, not pods.
- **target-cluster** — tenant plane. Ships its own Istio ambient mesh, runs `sample/nginx + sleep`, reachable cross-cluster via `nginx.target-cluster.global` → MetalLB `172.18.255.216` → virt-launcher proxy → VM `:30080`.
- **KubeUI** — React/TS + Go dashboard with three modes (`SRE | AI | Visual`). The AI mode talks to Sympozium. Four `SympoziumInstance` manifests ship in `06-sympozium/`: the always-on `cluster2-agent` (`.213`) serves KubeUI chat; `target-cluster-agent` (`.214`, with a custom `target-k8s-ops` `SkillPack`), `cost-analyzer` (`.218`), and `incident-responder` (`.219`) are demo-mode personas applied by `demo-sympozium.sh`. All four are driven by **local `llama3.2` via Ollama** on the Kind host — zero external LLM dependency. The backend (`ui/backend/handlers/ai.go`) already supports per-agent URL resolution via `SYMPOZIUM_AGENT_URL_<NAME>` env vars.
- **Golden image** pre-bakes k3s, airgap images, CA certs and kernel modules into a DataVolume, dropping cluster spin-up from ~10 min to ~2 min.

This is already a more sophisticated stack than most "AI for Kubernetes" demos — you have **VMs as first-class citizens**, **two control planes**, and a **service mesh that spans both**.

### 1.2 What Sympozium is

Think of it as "Helm for agents." Every primitive is a CRD:

| CRD | Role |
|---|---|
| `SympoziumInstance` | An agent persona — model, skills, policy, memory config |
| `AgentRun` | A single execution → reconciled into an ephemeral Job/Pod |
| `SkillPack` | A bundle of tools shipped as **sidecar containers** with ephemeral, least-privilege RBAC that is garbage-collected when the run completes |
| `SympoziumPolicy` | Admission-webhook gate — decides at Pod creation time whether a feature/tool is allowed |
| `SympoziumSchedule` | Cron + heartbeat triggers — wakes an agent periodically, with optional memory injection |
| `PersonaPack` | Helm-style bundle of Instances + Skills + Schedules + Policies |
| `Channel` | Slack/Discord/Teams bridge |

Built-in skill packs worth knowing: `k8s-ops` (kubectl-style operations), `incident-response`, `code-review`. Built-in persona packs: `platform-team` (SRE + Security), `devops-essentials` (Incident Responder). Sympozium works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — OpenAI, Azure, TCS GenAI Lab proxy, **llama.cpp / vLLM / Ollama / Unsloth** served locally.

### 1.3 Why this pairing matters

Most agentic-Kubernetes work assumes pod-native workloads on a single cluster with cloud LLMs. Your platform breaks all three assumptions:

1. **VMs are first-class.** An agent that only speaks `kubectl get pods` is half-blind — it cannot reason about `VirtualMachine`, `VirtualMachineInstance`, `DataVolume`, `CDI`, `virt-launcher`, cloud-init, or live migration.
2. **Two control planes.** A cluster2 incident ("the VM is stuck in `Scheduling`") is **not** a target-cluster incident ("nginx pod is `CrashLoopBackOff`"), and vice versa. Agents must know which plane they're on, and how to hop between them.
3. **Sovereignty is a hard constraint.** External LLM egress is often forbidden. The platform must work with a locally served model as the primary path, and the agent fleet must degrade gracefully when network egress is clipped.

Sympozium's Kubernetes-native isolation, ephemeral RBAC, admission-gated tools, and provider-agnostic LLM layer make it the right substrate — but the **agent fleet you ship on top of it** is where the value lives. The rest of this document is that fleet.

---

## Architecture Constraints

These are the hard rules every change to the agentic layer must satisfy. `CLAUDE.md` points future contributors here. If a proposed agent, skill pack, policy, or schedule violates one of these, stop and either revise the design or amend this section explicitly — do not ship around it.

1. **Local-LLM-first.** Every `SympoziumInstance` must default to a locally served model reachable from cluster2 (currently `llama3.2` via Ollama at `http://172.18.0.1:11434/v1`). A cloud LLM is allowed only as a per-persona opt-in for non-sensitive work (e.g. doc drafting) and must never be the fallback.
2. **Ollama host endpoint is pinned.** From cluster2 pods use `http://172.18.0.1:11434/v1` — **not** `host.docker.internal`, which does not resolve in Kind-on-Linux.
3. **MetalLB pool discipline.** The cluster2 pool is `172.18.255.211–220`. Any new assignment lands in the same PR across three places: the `CLAUDE.md` IP table, `sympozium-lb-setup.sh`, and `run-ui.sh`. Drift between these is a bug.
4. **Egress allowlist.** Agent pods get DNS + the Sympozium event bus by default. Any other outbound — the Ollama host endpoint (`172.18.0.1:11434`), the in-cluster kube API, the target-cluster API (`172.18.255.215:6443`), or future ports — must be enumerated in a shipped `SympoziumPolicy` in `06-sympozium/policies/` and bound to the `SympoziumInstance` via `spec.policyRef`. Do not paper over gaps with ad-hoc `NetworkPolicy` objects outside `06-sympozium/`.
5. **Warmth is mandatory.** No persona may enter the fleet without a warm-path guarantee — either a dedicated `SympoziumSchedule` heartbeat or coverage by an existing pack-level warm agent that keeps the shared Ollama model resident. Cold-start for llama3.2 on CPU is ~28–30s; unwarmed agents time out the first real request.
6. **Audit is append-only.** Every `AgentRun` remains queryable as a first-class Kubernetes object. No design may erase, short-circuit, or replace that trail — if durable off-cluster storage is added later it mirrors `AgentRun`s, it does not replace them.
7. **Tenant isolation = namespace isolation.** One namespace per tenant agent fleet, one `ServiceAccount` per `SympoziumInstance`, no cross-tenant bindings. Sympozium's RBAC gives this for free; opting out requires a written exception in this section.
8. **Sandbox free-form chat.** Any agent that accepts unfiltered end-user prompts (e.g. `cluster2-agent` behind KubeUI AI mode) runs under a `sympozium-sandbox-restricted`-style `SympoziumPolicy`: DNS + Ollama host IP + required K8s API ports only. No broad egress.
   *Fast pre-model guard:* KubeUI chat can also be screened before it reaches any agent. `ui/backend/handlers/guard.go` asks a local Laya classifier (Apache-2.0, offline, ~30 ms on GPU) whether the message is destructive or an injection/secret/privilege attempt, and refuses it without creating an AgentRun. Opt-in via `RUN_LAYA_GUARD=1`. It sits in front of this constraint and doesn't replace it: a classifier can be evaded, so the policy and RBAC still have to hold on their own. Laya was also measured for routing and incident triage and failed there (route 0.46, action 0.33 top-1), so it is used only as a guard.

§4 below ("Sovereignty Considerations") expands on the *why* behind several of these rules; this section is the checkable contract.

## 2. Strategic Framing: The Three-Plane Agent Fleet

Structure the agent fleet to match your topology. One agent registry per plane, each with its own RBAC scope, skill pack, and policy profile.

```

Three **operational** planes plus a shared **cross-cutting** layer of agents that pull from all three. Every agent is one `SympoziumInstance`; every persona pack bundles the instances that belong together.

---

## 3. The Full Use-Case Catalog

Below is the exhaustive catalog — organized by plane, then by agent persona. Each persona lists its skill set, trigger model (reactive, scheduled, or conversational), and a concrete task example that slots straight into a `SympoziumSchedule` or `AgentRun`.

### 3.1 Infrastructure Plane (cluster2)

These agents own the lifecycle of the VMs and the management cluster itself. RBAC: broad on `kubevirt.io`, `cdi.kubevirt.io`, `cluster.x-k8s.io`, `infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io`.

#### 3.1.1 VM Lifecycle Warden
- **What it does:** Watches `VirtualMachineInstance` phase transitions; diagnoses `Scheduling`, `Pending`, `Unknown`, `Failed`.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + custom `kubevirt-ops` (virtctl, libvirt XML dump, `virt-launcher` logs).
- **Trigger:** Heartbeat every 2 min + event-driven on `Warning` events in `kubevirt` namespace.
- **Task example:** *"Find all VMIs not in `Running` phase. For each, check: DataVolume ready? CPU/memory pressure on node? virt-launcher pod scheduled? Report root cause and, if safe and idle > 10 min, restart the VMI."*
- **Value:** Replaces the manual `kubectl describe vmi` → `kubectl logs virt-launcher-*` → `kubectl describe datavolume` loop.

#### 3.1.2 CAPI/CAPK Cluster Provisioner
- **What it does:** Turns natural-language cluster specs into `Cluster` + `KubevirtCluster` + `KubeadmControlPlane` + `KubevirtMachineTemplate` manifests, then drives the rollout.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + custom `capi-ops` (clusterctl, templated manifest generation).
- **Trigger:** Conversational only (KubeUI AI mode).
- **Task example:** *"Create a tenant cluster named `tenant-alpha` in the `tenants` namespace — 1 CP, 2 workers, 4 CPU / 8Gi each, using the golden image, expose the API server via MetalLB, enroll ambient mesh."*
- **Value:** Self-service cluster provisioning without learning the CAPI YAML shape.

#### 3.1.3 Golden Image Curator
- **What it does:** Watches for new k3s/Kubernetes releases, CVEs in baked components, or drifted CA bundles; proposes a new golden image bake with a diff summary.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `code-review` + custom `image-bake` (wraps `bake-golden-image.sh`).
- **Trigger:** Scheduled weekly + CVE feed webhook.
- **Task example:** *"Check the current `ubuntu-noble-dv` DataVolume. Compare baked k3s version against the latest stable. Scan for CVEs in the airgap image set. If any critical, open a PR against `bake-golden-image.sh` with the version bump and a changelog."*
- **Value:** Supply-chain hygiene for the base image — the thing every VM inherits.

#### 3.1.4 CDI / DataVolume Custodian
- **What it does:** Manages `DataVolume` lifecycle — pruning orphans, rebuilding corrupted sources, pre-warming common images.
- **Skills:** `kubevirt-ops` + `storage-ops`.
- **Trigger:** Scheduled nightly sweep.
- **Task example:** *"Enumerate all DataVolumes. Flag any `Failed` or `Pending` > 1h. Flag any DV not referenced by a VM or VMTemplate and older than 7 days. Pre-pull the 3 most-referenced DVs onto all Kind nodes."*
- **Value:** Storage hygiene that prevents "cluster spin-up broke because the source DV disappeared" incidents.

#### 3.1.5 MetalLB IP-Space Accountant
- **What it does:** Tracks MetalLB pool utilization, reservations, and the mapping in your README (`.200 → httpbin`, `.216 → target-cluster-nginx`, etc.).
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `network-ops`.
- **Trigger:** On `Service` create/update.
- **Task example:** *"New LoadBalancer service created. Is there pool capacity? Is the allocated IP in the expected range for its cluster? Update the allocation ledger in `docs/metallb-allocations.md` via a PR."*
- **Value:** Keeps your documented IP assignments in sync with reality — which is already drifting.

### 3.2 Tenant Plane (target-cluster)

These agents own the workloads running *inside* the provisioned clusters. RBAC: scoped to the target cluster's kubeconfig, no cluster2 access.

#### 3.2.1 Target-Cluster SRE
- **What it does:** Node/pod/deployment health, rolling restarts, HPA tuning, PDB enforcement.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `incident-response`.
- **Trigger:** Heartbeat 5 min + alertmanager webhook.
- **Task example:** *"Health check: any nodes `NotReady`? Any pods `CrashLoopBackOff` > 3 restarts in last 30 min? Any `Pending` pods for > 5 min? For crashloops, fetch the last 100 log lines and propose a fix."*
- **Value:** Built-in via `devops-essentials` PersonaPack; customize the task prompt to name your namespaces.

#### 3.2.2 Workload Onboarder
- **What it does:** Takes a natural-language app description, outputs a Helm values.yaml / Kustomize overlay that conforms to house standards (resource limits, PDB, NetworkPolicy, Istio annotation).
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `code-review` + custom `helm-ops`.
- **Trigger:** Conversational.
- **Task example:** *"Deploy a Postgres 16 to `sample` namespace, 2 replicas, 1Gi memory each, pvc size 10Gi, enrolled in ambient mesh, expose read-only endpoint via MetalLB."*
- **Value:** Developer self-service with guardrails.

#### 3.2.3 Upgrade Orchestrator
- **What it does:** Drives a blue/green or rolling upgrade of a tenant cluster — cordon, drain, VM swap via CAPK rollout, verify, uncordon.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `capi-ops` + `kubevirt-ops`.
- **Trigger:** Conversational + scheduled change windows.
- **Task example:** *"Rolling-upgrade `target-cluster` worker pool from k3s v1.30.x to v1.31.y. One VM at a time. Verify workloads healthy after each swap. Roll back if PDB violated."*
- **Value:** The hardest thing a human operator does. Give it to an agent with a policy-gated apply.

#### 3.2.4 Chaos & Resilience Tester
- **What it does:** Injects faults (kill a VM, partition a node, throttle the CNI), observes, reports recovery time.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` + `kubevirt-ops` + `chaos-ops` (wraps chaos-mesh or custom VMI deletion).
- **Trigger:** Scheduled, off-hours, policy-gated to non-prod namespaces only.
- **Task example:** *"Pick a random worker VM in `target-cluster`. Delete it. Measure: how long until CAPK replaces it? How long until affected pods return to Ready? Write a report."*

### 3.3 Mesh Plane (cross-cluster)

These agents understand the cross-cluster story — ServiceEntries, DestinationRules, ztunnel mTLS, MetalLB hop boundaries. Must have read access to **both** kubeconfigs.

#### 3.3.1 Service-Mesh Diagnostician
- **What it does:** Given a failing request path (e.g. "cluster1 httpbin can't reach nginx.target-cluster.global"), walks every hop and localizes the fault.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` (dual-context) + custom `istio-ops` (istioctl proxy-config, ztunnel stats).
- **Trigger:** Conversational + Visual-mode click-through from the topology SVG.
- **Task example:** *"Curl from `mc-demo/sleep` to `nginx.target-cluster.global` is timing out. Walk the path: sleep → ztunnel → ServiceEntry → MetalLB 255.216 → virt-launcher → k3s VM → nginx. Report which hop is broken and why."*
- **Value:** This is the diagnostic **nobody on your team is good at yet** — too many layers. Perfect agent target.

#### 3.3.2 ServiceEntry Generator
- **What it does:** Publishes a service in one cluster into the mesh of the other. Generates the `ServiceEntry` + `DestinationRule` pair, reserves a MetalLB IP if needed, updates the proxy service on cluster2.
- **Skills:** `k8s-ops` (dual-context) + `istio-ops` + `network-ops`.
- **Trigger:** Conversational.
- **Task example:** *"Make `redis.sample` in target-cluster reachable from cluster1 as `redis.target-cluster.global`. Use the next free IP in the `.216–.220` range. Apply a 100 req/s circuit breaker."*

#### 3.3.3 mTLS / Zero-Trust Auditor
- **What it does:** Continuously verifies that ambient mesh mTLS is active on all enrolled namespaces; flags plain-text flows; recommends AuthorizationPolicy tightening.
- **Skills:** `istio-ops` + `security-ops`.
- **Trigger:** Daily heartbeat.
- **Task example:** *"Across both clusters, list every namespace. Which are ambient-enrolled? Which have AuthorizationPolicy? Are there any plain-text flows across the MetalLB boundary that should be carrying a peer identity?"*

### 3.4 Cross-Cutting: Security & Compliance

#### 3.4.1 RBAC Auditor
- Scans every `ClusterRoleBinding` + `RoleBinding` across both clusters. Flags wildcards, flags service accounts bound to `cluster-admin`, proposes least-privilege replacements. *(Scheduled weekly.)*

#### 3.4.2 Policy Guardian (OPA/Rego)
- Your repo already has Open Policy Agent (3.7% of code). Ship an agent that drafts Rego rules from natural-language constraints and runs them in dry-run before promoting to enforcing. *(Conversational + CI trigger.)*

#### 3.4.3 CVE Watcher
- Maps every container image and VM image to a CVE feed; opens issues with patch paths. *(Scheduled.)*

#### 3.4.4 Secret Hygiene Bot
- Flags in-cluster secrets older than 90 days, secrets mounted by more pods than necessary, and literal credentials in ConfigMaps. *(Scheduled.)*

#### 3.4.5 Ingress Surface Mapper
- Produces a daily report of every externally reachable endpoint (MetalLB LBs + LoadBalancer services + NodePorts) with its auth posture. *(Scheduled + on Service create.)*

### 3.5 Cross-Cutting: FinOps / Efficiency

#### 3.5.1 Idle VM Reaper
- Already in your repo as `cost-analyzer` — generalize it. Classify VMs by `CPU avg < 5% AND network idle for N hours` → propose stop. Human-in-the-loop approval. *(Scheduled nightly.)*

#### 3.5.2 Right-Sizer
- For every Deployment/StatefulSet in target-cluster, compare `requests` vs p95 usage over 7 days. Propose a diff. *(Scheduled weekly.)*

#### 3.5.3 Storage Reclaimer
- Orphaned PVCs, unbound PVs, oversized DataVolumes, old VM snapshots. *(Scheduled.)*

#### 3.5.4 Cluster Density Planner
- Given a workload forecast, recommends whether to scale the host Kind node, add a worker VM, or spin a whole new tenant cluster.

### 3.6 Cross-Cutting: Developer Experience

#### 3.6.1 Natural-Language KubeUI Command Bar
- The "AI Mode" in your UI today is a chat. Upgrade it so typing *"why is my sleep pod failing"* in any KubeUI view auto-fills the task context (cluster, namespace, selected resource) and dispatches an `AgentRun`.

#### 3.6.2 Onboarding Tour Guide
- An agent whose only job is to walk a new developer through the stack. Grounded in your `docs/` and `refdoc/` directories. *(Conversational.)*

#### 3.6.3 Manifest Linter/Explainer
- Paste any YAML — the agent explains what it does, what's missing for your house standards, and what the final applied state would look like.

#### 3.6.4 Incident Postmortem Drafter
- After a `Failed` `AgentRun` from the Incident Responder, this agent consumes the run's memory + event timeline + logs and drafts the postmortem (timeline, root cause, action items, prevention).

#### 3.6.5 Documentation Synchronizer
- Watches `README.md` + `docs/` against actual cluster state. When you add `.217` for `security-agent` but forget to update the IP table, it opens a doc PR.

### 3.7 Cross-Cutting: Observability

#### 3.7.1 Log Pattern Miner
- Sweeps pod logs across all namespaces hourly, clusters anomalies, surfaces the top 5 new error signatures.

#### 3.7.2 Metric Anomaly Explainer
- Given a Prometheus alert, correlates with recent Kubernetes events, deployments, and AgentRuns to produce a one-line root-cause guess.

#### 3.7.3 Topology Narrator
- Feeds the Visual-mode topology graph. When the user clicks an edge, the agent narrates "this is ambient-mTLS from ztunnel on node X to ztunnel on node Y, currently carrying ~40 req/s." Entirely grounded in live state.

## 4. Sovereignty Considerations (Non-Negotiables)

This is a *sovereign* cloud. The agent layer has constraints an open-internet platform doesn't. The checkable rules live in the **Architecture Constraints** section above; the paragraphs below explain the reasoning and record the historical gotchas so the rules don't get re-litigated.

1. **Local-LLM-first, cloud-LLM-optional.** Your current design nails this — Ollama on the Kind host at `http://172.18.0.1:11434`, referenced by `SympoziumInstance.spec.agents.default.baseURL`. Sympozium's node-probe DaemonSet will auto-discover models served on port 8080 (llama.cpp) or 8000 (vLLM). Treat any cloud LLM as an optional accelerator for specific non-sensitive personas (e.g. documentation drafting), never the default. Offer per-persona model selection in the UI.

2. **Warmth matters.** You already hit this with `make sympozium-warm`. On CPU, llama3.2 has a ~30s cold start. Build an always-on "keep-alive" agent whose only job is a 5-minute heartbeat that keeps the model resident. Every other agent benefits.

3. **Air-gap egress discipline.** Sympozium's default egress allowlist is `:443` and `:6443`. Your k3s VMs listen on `:6444` behind a ClusterIP translation — you already know this is a gotcha. Codify the fix as a shipped `SympoziumPolicy` in `06-sympozium/` so new clusters don't rediscover it.

4. **Sandbox the sandbox.** For any agent that accepts arbitrary prompts from end users (KubeUI chat), apply the `sympozium-sandbox-restricted` policy. That blocks egress to everything except DNS + localhost IPC. Outbound tool use stays inside the mesh.

5. **Tenant isolation = agent isolation.** If you ever grow beyond a demo, one SympoziumInstance per tenant, each with its own namespace, ServiceAccount, NetworkPolicy, and memory backend. Sympozium's Kubernetes-native RBAC gives this to you for free — but you have to opt in by naming namespaces per tenant.

6. **Audit everything.** Every `AgentRun` is already a Kubernetes object with a `.status.result`. Pipe them to a durable store (Loki / S3-compatible object storage in-cluster). For a sovereign platform, "who told the agent to do what, and what did it do" is a *regulatory* record, not a debugging aid.

7. **Model provenance.** Record which LLM (name + digest of weights if possible) produced each AgentRun output. If you ever need to reproduce a decision three years later, you'll need this.

---

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

Ship in phases. Each phase is independently demoable.

**Current State (as of 2026-04-24):** One `SympoziumInstance` serving on cluster2 (`cluster2-agent`, `.213`). The other three manifests (`target-cluster-agent`, `cost-analyzer`, `incident-responder`) exist in `06-sympozium/` but are applied only by `demo-sympozium.sh` on demand. No custom `SympoziumPolicy`, no `SympoziumSchedule` bound to any instance yet. The installed CRD set is: `sympoziuminstance`, `skillpack`, `sympoziumpolicy`, `sympoziumschedule`, `ensemble`, `agentrun`, `mcpserver`, `sympoziumconfig`. There is **no `PersonaPack` CRD** — bundling is done via `Ensemble` (stamps out instances from embedded personas) or via a kustomization over separate manifests. Three default policies ship unbound (`network-isolated`, `permissive`, `restrictive`); none match our requirements because `network-isolated`/`restrictive` set `denyAll: true` with no `allowedEgress` entries for Ollama or the kube API.

### Phase 0 — Tighten the foundation (1 week)
- Bundle the four `SympoziumInstance` YAMLs + the custom `target-k8s-ops` `SkillPack` + the Phase-0 policies + the warm schedule into `06-sympozium/kustomization.yaml` so Phase 0 installs and tears down in one `kubectl apply -k` / `delete -k`. Do not migrate to `Ensemble` yet — it stamps out new instances rather than referencing existing ones, and the working demos depend on the standalone manifests.
- Ship two custom `SympoziumPolicy`s in `06-sympozium/policies/`:
  - `sandbox-restricted` — bound to `cluster2-agent` (free-form chat surface): DNS + event bus + Ollama host (`172.18.0.1:11434`) + in-cluster kube API. Nothing else.
  - `target-reach` — bound to `target-cluster-agent`: the `sandbox-restricted` allowlist plus the target-cluster API at `172.18.255.215:6443`. (The legacy `:6444` note is an internal ClusterIP detail that does not apply to the agent's egress path.)
- Replace the manual `06-sympozium/ollama-warm.sh` with a `SympoziumSchedule` (`type: heartbeat`, `instanceRef: cluster2-agent`, every ~4 minutes). The script stays as a fallback; the `SympoziumSchedule` is the deliverable.

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure plane (2–3 weeks)
- Ship the **VM Lifecycle Warden**, **CDI Custodian**, **MetalLB Accountant** as one `infrastructure-team` PersonaPack.
- Wire them into KubeUI's SRE mode as toggleable heartbeats.

### Phase 2 — Mesh plane (2 weeks)
- Ship the **Service-Mesh Diagnostician** and **ServiceEntry Generator**. This is where you get the most "wow" per hour of work because cross-cluster Istio debugging is genuinely hard.
- Hook the Diagnostician to the Visual-mode topology: click any edge → run a diagnostic agent scoped to that edge.

### Phase 3 — Tenant plane & FinOps (2–3 weeks)
- Ship **Target-Cluster SRE** (fork of the `platform-team` pack), **Workload Onboarder**, generalized **Idle VM Reaper**, **Right-Sizer**.
- Add a per-persona model selector to KubeUI (local llama3.2 vs optional external).

### Phase 4 — Security & DevEx (ongoing)
- **RBAC Auditor**, **Policy Guardian**, **CVE Watcher**, **Onboarding Tour Guide**, **Postmortem Drafter**. Each is ~1–2 days of YAML + prompt engineering.

### Phase 5 — The Orchestrator agent
- A "planner" persona whose tools are *the other agents*. User asks "something's wrong with tenant-alpha" — planner decomposes into sub-tasks and dispatches `AgentRun`s to the right specialists, then summarizes. Sympozium doesn't ship this pattern out of the box, so it's the most ambitious item, but it's the unlock: one chat interface, a whole fleet behind it.

## 6. Build vs. Reuse: Concrete Mapping

Do not rebuild what Sympozium ships. Concrete guidance:

| Capability | Reuse | Build |
|---|---|---|
| SRE agent (cluster health, rollbacks) | `platform-team` PersonaPack + tweak prompts for your namespaces | — |
| Incident Responder | `devops-essentials` PersonaPack | — |
| Code Review agent | Built-in `code-review` skill | — |
| Security/RBAC base | `platform-team` Security persona as starting point | RBAC Auditor prompt + Rego integration |
| VM operations | — | Custom `kubevirt-ops` skill pack (virtctl sidecar) |
| CAPI operations | — | Custom `capi-ops` skill pack (clusterctl sidecar) |
| Istio cross-cluster diagnostics | — | Custom `istio-ops` skill pack (istioctl + ztunnel stats) |
| MetalLB accounting | — | Light custom skill + doc-PR sidecar |
| Local LLM serving | Sympozium's Unsloth/llama.cpp/vLLM/Ollama path | — |
| Memory / vector store | Sympozium's built-in memory | Optional: swap in a local vector DB if you outgrow it |
| Channel integrations | Built-in Slack/Discord/Teams | — |
| Audit trail | Every `AgentRun` is already a K8s object | Add a controller that mirrors runs to object storage |

The 80/20 rule: build three custom skill packs (`kubevirt-ops`, `capi-ops`, `istio-ops`) and maybe 15–20 bespoke prompts. Everything else you can reuse.

## 7. The Big Picture

You are not building "Claude for Kubernetes." You are building a **sovereign, air-gap-capable, VM-native, mesh-aware agentic control plane** — a category that barely exists in the open-source world today. Sympozium is the cleanest foundation for this; your KubeVirt + Istio ambient topology is an unusually rich substrate for agents to operate on. The competitive moat is specifically the combination of:

- VM-aware skill packs (nobody else has these in open source),
- Cross-cluster mesh diagnostics via agents (extremely hard to do well manually),
- Local-LLM-first sovereignty (the feature enterprise Europe / India / public sector buyers actually ask for),
- Kubernetes-native audit and RBAC for every agent action.

Execute Phase 0–1 well and you have a credible demo. Execute Phase 2–3 well and you have a product.
